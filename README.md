# jsonanalyser
Developed using REACT,a webpage designed to view the JSON object.

It contains two text areas.
  One will be fed with json to be analysed.
  The other will give the analysed output. 

It gives a clear cut differentiation between different data types of the value in json .
For those new to JSON and JavaScript, there is a helper utility which helps to parse the needed key or value from the json.
